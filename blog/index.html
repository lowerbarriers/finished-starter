## @file
## Blog listing page
##
## This page exists in the repo file structure here because jekyll's built-in paginator requires the pager be
## inserted on an html page named index.html in order to build the additional paths
## @see https://jekyllrb.com/docs/pagination/
##
## Note that the molecules/pager.html include does not require this, though without native paging this will not
## be useful unless you host where you can use a plugin.
##
## The setting for the paginator path is in _config.yml , and as you can see below the permalink option is commented
## out. This is all important for ensuring posts render paged at /blog
