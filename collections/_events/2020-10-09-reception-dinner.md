## Details

**This event is expressly by invitation only, with RSVP required.**

Come join us to celebrate! Italian dinner and lots of ambiance.

### Dress code

Dressy casual preferred? Like, what you'd wear to go to a nice dinner, knowing that some people there will be really
dressed up, but other people might just be in their nicest jeans. A sweet spot between there that matches your personality.

If you want to wear a white dress, you can, though it is after Labor Day, so... All we ask is that you don't wear anything
outrageous.

### Gifts and other things

It's not a big venue, so please do not bring in any gifts or other large items without discussing it with us first.

### After-party

When we get kicked out of Pop's, we're all 100% definitely going to [Rosie O'Grady's](http://rosieogradysirishpub.com/)
across the street for some nightcaps and dancing. Please bring your dancing shoes, and join us if you can stay out that late.
