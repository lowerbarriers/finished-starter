<p>
  Shelby is sunshine considerately wearing black so as not to blind you.
</p>

<p>
  She grew up in Troy, Michigan, youngest of three. After a brief stint in Virginia, she returned with her family
  to Michigan, and lived that community college and retail life. She met her first husband, moved to Flint, MI,
  and gave birth to perfect Ellie, to whom she is the ideal mother.
</p>

<p>
  Shelby describes herself as 'indoorsy', and loves reality TV like the various <em>Real Housewives</em> franchises.
  She's also super into podcasts, fat babies, Chili's and other chain restaurants, and alternately sipping Barefoot
  Riesling and getting backrubs from Brad.
