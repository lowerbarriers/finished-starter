<p>
  Steve's the guy you know has your back even if you don't look behind you.
</p>

<p>
  Mr. Czerniak retired after a successful career that culminated in fifteen years of experience as an internal
  consultant and “change agent.” His personal volunteer objective in retirement is to “derive personal satisfaction
  from helping others, and the organizations they operate, to develop and prosper.”
</p>

<p>
  Steve grew up in Muskegon, Michigan. He's the best dad a Brad could ask for. In retirement, aside from his volunteer
  work, he also enjoys pickleball, napping to golf on TV, and the useful arts; especially where his granddaughter Johnna
  is concerned.
