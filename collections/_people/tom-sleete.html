<p>
  Tom is many good adjectives. Let's go with <em>reliable</em> most of all.
</p>

<p>
  Mr. Sleete is a born-and-raised Detroiter. He was married to his wife, Moe, for 38½ years before her passing. Tom
  is a proud father of three children, and grandfather to two grandchildren.
</p>

<p>
  He taught History at Southfield-Lathrup High for like 40 years, with a stint at the best public high school in the nation,
  Thomas Jefferson High School of Science and Technology in Virginia. He's still active as an author and historian, and as
  a retiree consults for the College Board in AP US History.
</p>

<p>
  Tom starts his days, like clockwork, with a trip to the grocery store. He ends the day with his prayers. In between
  he makes the world that much brighter to his family and friends.
